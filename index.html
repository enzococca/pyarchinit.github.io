<p>The project “PyArchInit- python for archaeology” began in 2005 with the aim of developing a phyton’s plug-in for the open source software Qgis. PyArchinit comes mainly from the needs, ever more present in the archaeology community, to computerize the archaeological records using software, which handle alphanumeric, multimedia and topographical data in a single solution. This package aims to meet the requirements with a unique solution that guarantees over time stability, development, easy installation and update. The final goal is the creation of GIS platform with a high interoperability between different operating system, in which alphanumerical table, GIS geometries and multimedia data are within a single system. This allows to keep as much as possible the integrity of the raw data, providing to the archaeologist both a very fast and robust approach and, in meantime, it is an open system to changes and customizations by other developers.

The database management system of archaeological data is automatically installed both in Postgresql and in Spatialite. Different GUI, created to support of entering data, manage the database. It is structured in seven management GUI:

Stratigraphic units

Site

Chronology

Infrastructures

Taphonomy

Record Archaeological

Multimedia

The first part of the package includes the management of stratigraphic units (pyarchnit_US) because of the need to manage on situ the documentation of on going excavations. With pyArchInit we will try to bridge the gap between skills and knowledge acquired on an Academic level and daily life of archaeological fieldworks; moreover it will help the interaction with engineers, urban planners, government, Cultural Office administrators and all the agencies that gravitate around archaeological world.

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
